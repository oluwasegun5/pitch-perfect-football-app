# Pitch Perfect Backend

The Pitch Perfect backend is the application's core, built using Spring Boot 3.x. It provides API endpoints, WebSocket functionality, and integrations to power the football application.

## Features

The Pitch Perfect backend includes the following key features:

1. **Core Services**:
   - Match management (live scores, statistics, commentary)
   - Chat system (room management, messaging)
   - User management (authentication, preferences)

2. **WebSocket Architecture**:
   - Real-time match updates
   - Chat room messaging
   - User-specific notifications

3. **Database Integration**:
   - PostgreSQL for primary data storage
   - Redis for caching and WebSocket session management

4. **Security and Performance**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - WebSocket message validation and rate limiting
   - Caching and scaling strategies for high-performance

5. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API endpoints for various functionalities
   - WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates and chat

## Technology Stack

The Pitch Perfect backend is built using the following technology stack:

- **Spring Boot 3.x**: The core framework for building the application
- **Java 17**: The programming language used for the backend
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database for storing application data
- **Redis**: Used for caching and WebSocket session management
- **Maven**: The build and dependency management tool

## Development Setup

To set up the Pitch Perfect backend development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pitch-perfect-football-app.git
   ```

2. **Set up the Database**:
   - Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
   - Create a new database for the Pitch Perfect application.
   - Update the database connection details in the `application.properties` file.

3. **Set up Redis**:
   - Install Redis on your machine.
   - Update the Redis connection details in the `application.properties` file.

4. **Build and Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```
     cd pitch-perfect-football-app/backend
     ```
   - Build the application using Maven:
     ```
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Run the Spring Boot application:
     ```
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

5. **Verify the Setup**:
   - The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
   - You can use tools like Postman or Curl to interact with the API endpoints.
